# Social Network For Developers

This repository houses code created following the Udemy course 'MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js' (https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/). The app created during this course is a basic social network for developers with the ability to sign in, create profiles, edit profiles, add comments, etc. It connects to a local MongoDB database for development. I have been adding comments everywhere as I go in order to facilitate my own learning by making sure that I grasp every concept before moving on.
